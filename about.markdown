**Intro**\\
*Hi*, I'm **Jack Brandt**, a current young professional just starting out as an office clerk. But I aspire to become an actuary in the near future. I have already passed actuarial exams: `P`, `FM`, and `SRM`, and am actively pursuing further *SOA* requirements. I am eagerly striving for an opportunity to demonstrate my actuarial potential in a professional setting.

**Professional Background**\\
I have already proven my *technical and analytic* skills through pursuing undergraduate mathematical research. I developed my ability and passion for *explaining complicated topics to non-technical* individuals and groups through tutoring underprivileged students in the Spokane area. And, I have a strong history of *leadership* through *founding* of Gonzaga's `Future Actuary Club` and earning my `Eagle Scout` rank.

**Education/Skills**\\
I graduated from Gonzaga **Summa Cum Laude** in May of 2025 with a `B.S. in Mathematics` with a minor in `Data Science`. During my undergrad, I developed my skillset to include important actuarial tools like:
* **Excel**, including (but not limited to):
    * Pivot tables
    * VLOOKUP
    * Conditional Formatting
* **SQL**:
    * Queries
    * Joins
    * Filtering
* **Python**:
    * Scripting
    * Data Science work
    * Visualizations
* **R/RStudio**:
    * Probability
    * Statistics
    * Visualizations
* Various Office Tools
    * Microsoft Word
    * Outlook
    * PowerPoint
* Other:
    * GitHub
    * Jupyter Notebooks
    * HTML/CSS
Many, if not all, these skills, you'll see demonstrated across this website. So, if you want to see my proficiency in any of these tools just take a look around.

**That's Me**\\
Now that you know I aspire to be an actuary, and why I'm the best choice for your actuarial analyst role, here's a bit more about me.\\
