**Data**\\
The process continues much the same as yesterday. I finished formatting the data to be joined using pivot tables, removing obviously extraneous columns, and even removed two more whole, unnecessary datasets. I then finished joining the data so that now there is the *spending and payment* dataset and the *quality of care* dataset, each with roughly 6,000 rows. I'll include screenshots of each so that one can get an idea of the remaining cleaning needing to be done (e.g., handling missing values, formatting, consolidating columns), but also the progress made from having 74 different tables with hundreds of thousands of rows.

**QOC**\\

If you can't see anything in the QOC table it's because I had to zoom really far out to fit all of the columns in view. Obviously, there's a fair bit of work still to do. Some rows should be deleted as they have little data. And, still some columns that should be deleted for the same reason. I'm sure there's plenty more cleaning in addition to that. However, being able to even get it in this format after how it started is an accomplishment nonetheless.
