Today, I began work on a hobby actuarial work project to analyze value based care (VBC). Progress was made in researching what VBC means in 2025, how the insurance industry is involved, and in gathering data that a project like this may need. [Data.CMS.gov](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/search?theme=Hospitals) proved to be a great source of data for such a project.

As I understand it, many health actuaries' work revolves around doing analysis for VBC plans. It excites me to be glimpsing what my day-to-day work may look like once I've began my actuarial career. Now that I've grasped the topic and gathered the raw data, I can get my hands dirty and start doing the actual work. I can't wait!
