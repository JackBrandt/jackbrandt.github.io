**Studying**\\
As it's been one week since taking and passing exam SRM, my break/rest period is over and now it is time to begin studying for my next exam: FAM. I've heard FAM covers a lot of material so I'll be taking the sitting in October instead of the one in July, giving me 5 months to study instead of 1.5. I'm excited for this one as it is literally foundations of actuarial mathematics which leads me to believe it will be more closely related to actuarial work than the past few.
