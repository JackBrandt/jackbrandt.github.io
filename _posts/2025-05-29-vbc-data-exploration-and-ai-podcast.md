**AI Podcast**\\
SOA hosted an AI Insights podcast about how ai can help actuarial students study for exams. The podcast contained little that I didn't already know or hadn't thought about. My main take away was that, as a free resource, AI can provide assistance with studying but it can't do the learning for you. In many ways, it can act just like a tutor. Tutors can't take the exam for you, but they can answer any questions you need to be ready for the exam. Unlike most tutors, ChatGPT and other AIs are always available and never run out of patience, nor will they make you feel dumb for asking a stupid question.

**VBC Data Exploration**\\
With 74 hospital/provider datasets to work with, the first step was grouping them into categories so as to structure further exploration. Many datasets come as separate national, state, and provider, csvs so grouping them into subdirectories was a natural step. Not much progress was made exploring the data.
