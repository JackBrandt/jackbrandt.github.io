As an aspiring actuary, I created this site to showcase my potential and efforts. I'll update it as I have more to showcase.

Just 3 days ago, I sat for `exam SRM` and received the preliminary indication... that I passed! That makes 3 in a row that I passed. Here's to all the hard work that went into passing it, and all the hard work that will go into passing the next one.

Although I graduated without a job lined up, much less an actuarial one, I received an offer to start as an `office clerk (subrogation)` with `Claims Management Inc.` in Puyallup. I'm looking forward to the start of a successful career and to becoming a contributing member of their team.
