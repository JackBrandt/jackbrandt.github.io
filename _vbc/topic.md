**What is value based care (or VBC):**\\
VBC is defined as: "designing care so that it focuses on quality, provider performance and patient experience." Additionally, "the 'value' in value-based care refers to what an individual values most." \[[1](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/key-concepts/value-based-care)\]

**How this ties into the insurance industry:**\\
The VBC approach arose as an alternative to the fee-for-service payment system, which paid a fixed amount to healthcare providers for each service rendered. The old system of fee-for-service payment, comprehensive testing and diagnosis contributed to growing healthcare spending. The new system pays based on performance, safety, and cost of providers. Arguably, VBC incentivizes hospitals to prioritize providing higher quality care and to avoid unnecessary use of resources, leading to better patient satisfaction at a lower cost. It's the role of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private insurers utilizing the VBC approach to determine the structure of payments for a service and how provider care assessments affect those payment amounts. Additionally, many adjustments must be made regarding certain risk factors. For example, "hospitals that treat a large number of uninsured patients or teaching hospitals" will likely have higher costs associated with providing care. \[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK607995/)\]
